# NLP-Disaster Tweets
This repository will be creating a NLP model to predict if a disaster actually happened based off of tweets from Twitter.

## Overview
This repository is for MSDS 422 and will be looking at the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).


## Notebooks
- [NLP_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb](https://github.com/DrakeData/NLP-Disaster_Tweets/blob/main/NLP_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb): This is a Colab notebook that will house the code for MSDS 422 Assignment 9.

## Assignment Overview
- Assignment 9: Conduct EDA, build 3 RNN models based on hyperparameter tuning, evaluate goodness of fit metrics, make prediction on test data and send results to Kaggle.
